# BSTRotation
The method I worked on was the Rotate function. This project was a sense of direction to understand how a Binary Search Tree works and how it works when it is rotated either to the left or right.
I Worked on the Rotate method for a BST and created the test cases for left and right rotate, testing it on a null child and parent, and testing the insertion of a node.
